Welcome to the xbmc-on-imon!

This project is being moved from [github](http://github.com), so some parts are still linked to that website.

This project makes use of the iMON Display API from Soundgraph which allows to write 3rd party applications to show information on Soundgraph's VFDs and LCDs. Using XBMC's JSON RPC API information about the currently playing file is displayed.

The binaries ready to be downloaded at the [download area](http://github.com/BlackMan82/xbmc-on-imon/downloads) are still in beta version.

The necessary libraries in the repository (taken from projects [xbmc-jsonrpc-sharp](http://github.com/BlackMan82/xbmc-jsonrpc-sharp) and [imonapi-sharp](http://github.com/BlackMan82/imonapi-sharp)) may not always be the most up to date. However, if any significant modifications are made there, it is also updated within this project.

Please, feel free to create new issue at [Issues page](http://github.com/BlackMan82/xbmc-on-imon/issues) when a bug is found or new feature is requested (check if the bug or the request has not been added already). If you are not registered or do not want to sign up at [github](http://github.com), you can leave a message at [XBMC forum](http://forum.xbmc.org/showthread.php?p=987716).
